    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        4 large chicken legs, skin on, cut into drumsticks and thighs and scored
      </li>
      <li>Olive oil, for frying</li>
      <li>2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>Rice, to serve</li>
      <li>4-5 thyme sprigs, to garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 220°C/Gas 7.</li>
      <li>
        First prepare the marinade by combining all the ingredients with a good
        grinding of black pepper and a dash of oil. Rub the marinade into the
        chicken pieces, massaging it into the scored meat. Leave to marinate for
        at least 1 hour (or, better still, overnight).
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large ovenproof pan over a medium-high heat and add a dash of
        oil. Fry the chicken pieces for about 10 minutes until golden brown on
        all sides. Add the Worcestershire sauce and cook for 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with an ovenproof lid or foil and place in the preheated oven for
        20 minutes until cooked through (if your pan isn’t ovenproof, simply
        transfer the chicken to a roasting tray). Remove the foil for the last 5
        minutes if the chicken needs colouring a little more.
      </li>
      <li>Serve the chicken hot with rice.</li>
    </ol>
